                    &emsp;&emsp;Openglobus was created in 2013 by programmer Mikhail Gevlich, who worked in
                    geoinformation technology and was a dreamer. He wanted to make computer games, and create worlds and
                    was looking for an idea that would inspire him.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    &emsp;&emsp;One day he was challenged with the need to work with terrain in three-dimensional space.
                    The
                    visualization libraries that were available at the time did not meet his technical and aesthetic
                    requirements. So he decided to make his own tool that would allow him to render objects on the scale
                    of a planet and an ant at the same time.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    &emsp;&emsp;He was so fascinated by this process that he devoted all his free time to it. He wanted
                    to share
                    what he had with other programmers and made his library completely open. New people started coming
                    in, bringing new ideas into the Openglobus and using it for their own tasks. These were such
                    projects as weather visualization, 3D mapping of river and lake bottoms, mapping of satellite and
                    drone trajectories, creation of computer games, and route planning.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    &emsp;&emsp;At the moment, Openglobus is a popular and accessible tool for solving a large number of
                    different
                    tasks related to geoinformation technologies. Nowadays 3D technologies continue to evolve. The
                    metaverse, digital tweens, and augmented reality are becoming more and more prevalent in our daily
                    lives. The development of drones, the aerospace industry, increasing computer performance, and cloud
                    technologies confirm that 3D visualization tools will be in demand, and the Openglobus will continue
                    to evolve and grow.
